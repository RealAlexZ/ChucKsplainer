Here's a ChucK code example that creates an ensemble performance with both traditional and non-traditional instruments:

```chuck
// Create different instruments
SinOsc drone => NRev rev1 => dac;
StifKarp plucky => NRev rev2 => dac;
ModalBar bells => NRev rev3 => dac;
Shakers shak => NRev rev4 => dac;

// Set reverb levels
0.1 => rev1.mix;
0.2 => rev2.mix;
0.3 => rev3.mix;
0.2 => rev4.mix;

// Define scales and melodies
[0, 4, 7, 11, 12] @=> int pentatonic[];
[0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] @=> int minorScale[];

// Function to get random element from array
fun int randomNote(int arr[]) {
    return arr[Math.random2(0, arr.cap()-1)];
}

// Set base frequency and volumes
220.0 => drone.freq;
0.2 => drone.gain;
0.4 => plucky.gain;
0.3 => bells.gain;
0.5 => shak.gain;

// Main performance loop
while(true) {
    // Drone layer
    if(Math.random2(0,10) > 8) {
        220.0 * Math.pow(1.5, Math.random2(0,2)) => drone.freq;
    }
    
    // Plucky melody
    if(Math.random2(0,1) == 1) {
        std.mtof(60 + randomNote(pentatonic)) => plucky.freq;
        plucky.noteOn(Math.random2f(0.2, 0.8));
    }
    
    // Bell sounds
    if(Math.random2(0,3) == 0) {
        std.mtof(72 + randomNote(minorScale)) => bells.freq;
        bells.noteOn(Math.random2f(0.3, 0.9));
    }
    
    // Percussion
    if(Math.random2(0,2) == 0) {
        Math.random2(0, 22) => shak.preset;
        shak.noteOn(Math.random2f(0.4, 1.0));
    }
    
    // Random timing between events
    Math.random2(100, 400)::ms => now;
}
```

This code creates an ensemble with:
1. A drone using SinOsc for ambient background
2. A plucked string instrument (StifKarp) playing melodic patterns
3. Modal bells for occasional crystalline sounds
4. Shakers for percussion elements

The ensemble features:
- Different reverb levels for each instrument
- Pentatonic and minor scales for melodic elements
- Random variations in timing, pitch, and intensity
- Non-traditional elements like the evolving drone and various shaker sounds
- Probability-based triggering of different instruments

To run this, simply save it as a .ck file and execute it with ChucK. The performance will continue indefinitely, creating an ever-evolving ambient ensemble piece.

Each instrument plays according to different probabilities and patterns:
- The drone changes occasionally for variation
- The plucky instrument plays more frequently with pentatonic notes
- The bells play less frequently with minor scale notes
- The shakers add rhythmic elements with various presets

Feel free to modify the probabilities, scales, or timing to create different variations of the ensemble performance!
