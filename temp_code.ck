Based on the requirements and available documentation, I'll create a techno bass sound panned to the left. Here's the code with detailed comments:

```chuck
// Create a basic techno bass using SqrOsc (square wave oscillator)
SqrOsc bass => LPF filter => Pan2 panner => dac;

// Set up basic parameters
120 => float tempo;
(60.0/tempo)::second => dur beat;

// Configure the bass sound
50.0 => bass.freq;  // Low frequency for bass
0.7 => bass.gain;   // Set volume

// Configure filter for classic techno sound
100.0 => filter.freq;
5.0 => filter.Q;    // Resonance for more character

// Pan to the left (-1.0 is hard left, 1.0 is hard right)
-0.8 => panner.pan; // Slightly off hard left for more natural sound

// Main loop for the bassline pattern
while(true) {
    // Basic techno pattern
    1 => bass.gain;
    0.125::beat => now;
    0 => bass.gain;
    0.125::beat => now;
    
    // Add some filter sweep for movement
    Math.sin(now/second * 2.0) * 500.0 + 800.0 => filter.freq;
}
```

This code:
1. Creates a signal chain using a square wave oscillator (SqrOsc) for the bass sound
2. Adds a low-pass filter (LPF) for tone shaping
3. Uses Pan2 to position the sound in the stereo field
4. Creates a basic techno rhythm pattern
5. Includes filter modulation for movement

You can modify parameters like:
- `tempo` for different speeds
- `bass.freq` for different bass notes
- `filter.freq` and `filter.Q` for different timbres
- `panner.pan` for different stereo positions

The bassline will play continuously with a typical techno rhythm and filter sweep for added movement.
