Based on the requirements, I'll create a techno bass sound panned to the left using a combination of SawOsc (for the characteristic techno sound) and filters, with appropriate timing and modulation.

```chuck
// Techno bass generator with left panning

// Create basic oscillator and filter chain
SawOsc saw => LPF lpf => Pan2 panner => dac;

// Set up initial parameters
220.0 => float baseFreq; // A3 as base frequency
baseFreq => saw.freq;
0.3 => saw.gain;  // Set initial volume

// Filter settings for techno bass character
baseFreq * 2.5 => lpf.freq;  // Cut-off frequency
2.0 => lpf.Q;  // Resonance

// Pan settings (-1 = full left, 0 = center, 1 = right)
-0.8 => panner.pan;  // Pan mostly to left but not completely

// Time settings
140 => float bpm;  // Typical techno tempo
(60.0/bpm)::second => dur beat;
beat/4 => dur sixteenth;  // For rhythmic variation

// Main sequence loop
while(true) {
    // Basic rhythm pattern
    for(0 => int i; i < 16; i++) {
        // Add some rhythmic variation
        if(i % 4 == 0) {
            // Emphasis on quarter notes
            0.4 => saw.gain;
            baseFreq => saw.freq;
        } else if(i % 2 == 0) {
            // Lighter touch on eighth notes
            0.2 => saw.gain;
            baseFreq * 1.5 => saw.freq;
        } else {
            // Subtle notes in between
            0.15 => saw.gain;
            baseFreq => saw.freq;
        }
        
        // Filter modulation for movement
        baseFreq * (2.0 + Math.sin(now/beat * 2*pi)*0.5) => lpf.freq;
        
        // Advance time
        sixteenth => now;
    }
}
```

This code:
1. Creates a basic techno bass using a saw wave oscillator
2. Implements a low-pass filter for the characteristic techno sound
3. Uses Pan2 to position the sound in the left channel
4. Creates a rhythmic pattern typical of techno bass lines
5. Includes modulation of the filter frequency for movement
6. Uses standard techno tempo (140 BPM)
7. Includes gain variations for dynamic interest

The sound will be:
- Predominantly in the left channel
- Have a characteristic techno bass timbre
- Include rhythmic variation
- Have subtle modulation for movement
- Be at an appropriate volume level for mixing

You can modify the baseFreq, panning amount, or rhythm pattern to taste. The code is structured to be easily modified and extended.
