# 3D Modeling of Musical Instruments

This repository documents 3D-modeled musical instrument designs created using Rhinoceros 3D and OpenSCAD.

## Design 1: Teenage Erhu  
**Designed in Rhinoceros 3D**

The Teenage Erhu (left) is a performance piece as much as it is a musical instrument. Inspired by Erhu #2524 from the University of Michigan’s Stearns Collection (right), it reimagines the Erhu, the ancient Chinese two-stringed fiddle. Its bright and often times squeaky timbre embraces imperfection as central to its aesthetics.  

Standing at 60 cm tall, the Teenage Erhu is crafted with a modular design; individually printed sound box, head, and pegs enables further personal customization. Its neck, a simple wooden dowel, grounds the instrument’s digital fabrication. The classic snakeskin membrane gives way to a carefully engineered and environmentally friendly synthetic layer.


## Design 2: Saxophone Mouthpiece  
**Designed in Rhinoceros 3D**
